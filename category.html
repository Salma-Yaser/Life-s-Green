          <p class="desc">
            In simple words, mulch is basically a protective cover. Made from dried leaves, bark, or compost, mulch is
            spread around trees or plants in order to enrich or insulate the soil. Not only does mulch help enrich the
            soil but also helps prevent the growth of weeds and helps keep pests away from plants.

            While you can, of course, buy commercially-produced mulch, there are a few ways that you can make your own
            mulch that will undoubtedly be more cost-effective & fast!

            Pollinators like butterflies and bees are certainly a thing of adoration. But more often than not, we
            dismiss their importance and tend to forget that they're the reason why our ecosystem continues to thrive
            and excel.

            So, if we are aware of their significance and the role they so gracefully play - even if unknowingly so -
            what part can we play to protect the peace and be catalysts in nature's unexplainably effective processes?

            As part of the huge Bromeliad family of tropical plants, the Earth Star - also called the Cryptanthus plant
            - hails from the tropical, hot and humid forests of Brazil. Many Bromeliad plants grow as epiphytes, meaning
            they grow right on top of other plants but survive without extracting any nutrients from them. However,
            Earth Star plants grow on the floor of the dense forest area in spaces where light filters through the thick
            canopy.

            <h3>Understanding Xeriscaping - Here's What You Should Know About It</h3>
            <p>February 13, 2024</p>
          </div>
          <p class="desc">
            Xeriscaping emerged as a response to water scarcity, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions. Originating
            from the Greek word "xeros," meaning dry, this landscaping approach was developed in the 1980s in Colorado,
            USA.

            Initially conceived as an idea to address water conservation in dry climates, Xeriscaping has since gained
            popularity worldwide due to its eco-friendly and low-maintenance nature.
